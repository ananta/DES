# Basic DES Algorithm

This is a basic application built on top of node.js to illustrate the working mechanism of DES algorithm according to [example](http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/teaching/hess/krypto-ws2006/des.htm) - The DES Algorithm Illustrated

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have a working Nodejs runtime environment.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/ananta/DES DES
```

And run the project using

```
cd DES
npm start
```

The start script triggers `node app.js`
